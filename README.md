## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of radar principles
- Experience with PCB assembly (for hardware build)
- Python 3.8+ for the GUI software
- FPGA development tools (Vivado) for signal processing modifications

### Hardware Assembly

1. **Order PCBs**: All Gerber files are available in `/4_Schematics and Boards Layout`
2. **Source Components**: Bill of materials (BOM) in `/4_Schematics and Boards Layout/4_7_Production Files`
3. **Assembly**: Follow the assembly guide in `/10_docs/assembly_guide.md`
4. **Antenna**: Choose appropriate array for your version
5. **Enclosure**: 3D printable files in `/10_docs/Hardware/Enclosure`

## 📜 License

This project is open-source but uses **different licenses for hardware and software** to ensure proper legal coverage.

### Hardware Documentation
The hardware design files—including:
- Schematics and PCB layouts (in `/4_Schematics and Boards Layout`)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) files
- Gerber files and manufacturing outputs
- Mechanical drawings and enclosure designs

are licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 – Permissive (CERN-OHL-P)** .

This is a hardware-specific license that:
- ✅ Clearly defines "Hardware," "Documentation," and "Products"
- ✅ Includes explicit patent protection for contributors and users
- ✅ Provides stronger liability limitations (important for high-power RF)
- ✅ Aligns with professional open-hardware standards (CERN, OSHWA)

You may use, modify, and sell products based on these designs, provided you:
- Maintain the original copyright notices
- Distribute any modified designs under the same license
- Make your modifications available in Source format

### Software and Firmware
The software components—including:
- FPGA code (VHDL/Verilog in `/9_Firmware`)
- Microcontroller firmware (STM32)
- Python GUI and utilities

remain under the **MIT License** for maximum flexibility.

### Full License Texts
- The complete CERN-OHL-P license text is in the `LICENSE` file
- MIT license terms apply to software where not otherwise specified

### Why This Change?
Originally, the entire project used the MIT license. The community (special thanks to gmaynez!) pointed out that MIT lacks legal protections needed for physical hardware. The switch to CERN-OHL-P ensures the project is properly protected while maintaining the same permissive spirit.
